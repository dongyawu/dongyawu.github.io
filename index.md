## Research interest

I am interested in **Genome evolution and trait innovation**. With more genomes to be deciphered (e.g. the Earth BioGenome Project), mechanisms underlying species evolution and trait innovation are going to be elucidated through genomics, by integrating multi-omics data and multi-disciplinary methods. My PhD study is mainly about Poaceae crop evolution (e.g. rice and barnyard grass) and aims to facilitate crop production from the view of evolution.

### Plant adaptation and domestication through comparative genomics and population genomics
At individual level, combining genome assemblies, transcriptomics, epi-genomics and other omics data could uncover the mechanism of plant adaptation under stress (e.g. disease resistance). At population level, population genome re-sequencing and GWAS or whole-genome selection scan are powerful ways to exploit key genes regulating plant adaptation (natural population) or agronomic traits (crop).
### Discordance in phylogeny inference
  Horizontal transfer, gene introgression, in-complete lineage sorting would result in the discordance in gene phylogeny inference (e.g. in Poaceae). How frequent they are across plants and other kingdoms and how they affect species adaptation are interesting questions to explore. For example, I have identified several important genes which could putatively enhance the crop adaptation and resistance in Poaceae.
### Convergent evolution and accelerating breeding
  Traditional gene fine-mapping seems not practicable for orphan crops and the cross-species whole-genome selection analyzes may provide a faster way to excavate target loci for improvement, from the view of convergent evolution. By utilizing the genetic resources from other species, the improvement of orphan crops could be accelerated. Meanwhile, superior resistance genes from orphan crops could be utilized in the improvement of main crops.
